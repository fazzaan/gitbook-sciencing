# Communication in Science

science has a lot of problems

most of those problems go by the name of _homo sapiens_&#x20;

also often due to lack of clear communication between different knowledge levels of people



Clear communication requires information to be presented in a way that is understandable and relevant to the target audience&#x20;



Also it is often beneficial for scientists to obfuscate their explanations so that they can get funding for bullshit projects (see page [scientists-lie.md](scientists-lie.md "mention")).
