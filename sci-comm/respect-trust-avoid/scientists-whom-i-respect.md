# Scientists whom I respect

Here's a list of scientists whom I respect, listen to and value.

They are true scientists and they don't abide dogmatism and other such nonsense.

Many of them vocally question & challenge the very foundations of science...

Why is this a good thing?

Because, like all things in human life, ego exists. Groups institutionalize ways of thinking, ideas become entrenched, and questioning certain figures becomes unacceptable.

And this is the start of dogmatism and eventually, religiosity.
