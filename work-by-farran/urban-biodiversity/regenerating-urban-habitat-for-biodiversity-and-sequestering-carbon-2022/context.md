# Context

An urban environment is a type of ecosystem, and contains various green spaces: parks, sports fields, allotments, gardens.

Because of anthropogenic fragmentation of wild ecosystems, urbs are becoming increasingly important in conservation of wild species and supporting ecosystem services â€“ Singapore harbours 40+ endangered and vulnerable plant species (Maseyk, 2021).

Regeneration extends and improves habitat stability, biodiversity and connectivity, and connects species across developed regions, supporting population size & health and preventing extirpation. Protecting native species from invaders is of utmost importance, because non-native species are not kept in check outside their native habitats (Holl & Brancalio, 2020). Biodiversity is a self-regulatory stabiliser of climatic fluctuations, providing adaptability and endurance for the continued provision of ecosystem services.

However, anthropogenic atmospheric pollution increases unabated; investing in a survivable future for our children means investing in carbon sequestration today. Selecting certain tree and plant species helps sequester more efficiently and support local biodiversity.
