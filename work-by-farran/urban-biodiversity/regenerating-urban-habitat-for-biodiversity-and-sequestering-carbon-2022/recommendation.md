# Recommendation

I recommend site C.

With more edge-habitat than B, but less than A, half of it touches the river, providing species with air and water connectivity; greater habitat heterogeneity; more carbon sequestration methods.

Passing under bridges, spanning the city, it prevents sinks and completely interconnects city habitats with surrounding landscape.
