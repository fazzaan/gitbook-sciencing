# Future projects — plans & ideas

What topics pique your interest?

The next steps of my career development involve data visualisation.&#x20;

I'm gonna create some imagery and whatnot to practise the necessary skills and produce a portfolio.

I have some favourite topics of my own, but I'd also love to produce things that you wanna see.
