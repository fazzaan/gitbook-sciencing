# Future projects — plans & ideas

What topics pique your interest?

The next steps of my career development involve data visualisation.&#x20;

I'm gonna create some imagery and whatnot to practise the necessary skills and produce a portfolio.

I have some favourite topics of my own, but I'd also love to produce things that you wanna see.

## Dāta vis̈ūalīzā́ťion

Data visualization is a major component of scientific work.

Not only is it important for scientists in understanding their research data and working together; it is also _**vital**_ in communicating the scientific research findings to the governments, corporations, and [the people at large](#user-content-fn-1)[^1].

Developing skills in visualizing data is very important for spreading our discoveries. It overlaps with skills in graphic design and graphical software, as well as presentation & layout skills.&#x20;
