# Appendix 3 – Text-based tables

Tables in the main report were rendered to images to exclude them from the word count and to ensure correct appearance. They are presented again here for ease of access, so that content can be extracted by future readers and researchers.

## Table 1 – Phase 2 statistical analysis results summary

_Summary of Phase 2 statistical analysis results of gene expression in pairwise comparison sets._

_Foldchange was calculated as ratio between averages of each sample set. Statistical analysis of each gene’s expression data produced_ &#x70;_-values. Orange highlights OAS1 in Set B because its p-value is **almost** <0.05. STAT1 and OASL included for context._

**Actually the text-based tables from Microsoft Word are totally incompatible with GitBook's tabulation system. You can download the files later — if they're not yet available, contact me.**

## Table 2 – Gene distribution summary from HPA

_Distribution of study genes throughout key cells and cellular components in asthma. Information collated from Human Protein Atlas (2023a, 2023b, 2023c, 2023d)._
