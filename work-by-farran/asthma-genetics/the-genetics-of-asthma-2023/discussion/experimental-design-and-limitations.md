# Experimental design & limitations

## Original experiment

Improvements: extending infection exposure time, increasing analysis frequency, increasing donors quantity and providing additional donors information (ethnicity, asthma type & severity, comorbidities).

## Statistical analysis

Small sample size affected result quality: six pushes the Wilcoxon test's lower limit. In Excel, for accuracy, raw data was never modified and cell referencing was always used in formulae.

## Literature research

This process started unstructured and hard to manage, but was refined over time and robust methods of recording information were developed.

Additional literature research, and possibly experimental research too, is required to see if this DGE pattern still exists in asthmatic response without HRV or other viral challenge.
