# Phase 2 – Statistical analysis

Significant DGEs in Sets A, B & D imply HRV16 affects expression in asthmatic and non-asthmatic tissues differently, suggesting involvement of these genes in the asthmatic response to HRV16. Significant DGE in Set D (vehicle vs HRV) shows HRV16’s effect in non-asthmatic tissues, showing that these genes may be part of the innate antiviral response; this is corroborated by Human Protein Atlas (2023a, 2023b, 2023c) (details in _Results: Phase 3_ & _Discussion: Phase 3_). Set A, showing asthmatic response to HRV16, can be calibrated using Set D as a baseline, the non-asthmatic response to HRV16. See _Fig. 2 (Results)_ for chart comparison.

In Set C (non-asthmatic vs asthmatic with vehicle), DGE was small and statistically insignificant, suggesting similar expression in asthmatics and non-asthmatics under normal, non-infected conditions. This aligns with expectations as these genes haven’t previously been linked to asthma.

These statistical outcomes match expectations of DGE response to HRV16: in non‑asthmatics, because HRV16 is a common respiratory virus; in asthmatics, because asthma is a respiratory disease.

Conversely, it was surprising because these are prominent genes, involved in the JAK‑STAT cascade and antiviral cellular defence, and there’s no prior research implicating them in asthma.
