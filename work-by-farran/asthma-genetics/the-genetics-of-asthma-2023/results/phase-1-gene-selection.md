# Phase 1 – Gene selection

Data from Bai J _et al._ (2015) were filtered and sorted by foldchange to determine the most-changed genes under HRV16 in asthmatics (_Fig.1a, Col.O_). Preliminary research revealed that most of the top genes were already well-researched regarding relationship to asthma.

To see the most-significant, Set A was sorted by _p_-value of DGE (_Fig.1b_). STAT2, OAS1, OAS2, OAS3 were chosen: an initial search of the literature showed these hadn’t been researched regarding involvement in asthma and, given their roles in viral response pathways (STAT activating OAS; OAS terminating RNA, inhibiting viral synthesis) and how viral infections aggravate asthma, it is worth investigating these genes to discover their part in asthma.

* _Data sorted by foldchange, then by p-value._&#x20;
* _Basic research on each gene was added, revealing suitability for research._&#x20;
* _Gene rows were coloured on suitability (red: unsuitable; yellow: consider; green: potential research candidates)._&#x20;
* _Green boxes highlight sorted column; blue boxes highlight columns added to contain preliminary research notes._
