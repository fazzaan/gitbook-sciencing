# Phase 2 – Statistical analysis

Asthmatics and non-asthmatics have increased expression of STAT2 and OAS genes after HRV challenge. Asthmatics have higher DGE than non-asthmatics.

_**Table 1**: Summary of Phase 2 statistical analysis results of gene expression in pairwise comparison sets._

* _Foldchange was calculated as ratio between averages of each sample set._&#x20;
* _Statistical analysis of each gene’s expression data produced p-values._&#x20;
* _Orange highlights OAS1 in Set B because its p-value is almost <0.05._&#x20;
* _STAT1 and OASL included for context._
* _See Appendix 3 for supplementary text-based tables._

## Sets A & D – Wilcoxon Matched Pairs test

Null hypotheses rejected.

All tests showed HRV16 significantly affected DGE of OAS1,2&3 and STAT2 in asthmatic compared to non-asthmatic lung tissue (W(0) = 0, _p_≤0.05, two-tailed).

## Sets B & C – Mann–Whitney _U_-test

**Set B (α:γ): null hypotheses rejected, barring OAS1.**

Three sets showed HRV16 challenge significantly affected DGE in asthmatic tissues compared to non-asthmatic. OAS1 had almost-significant DGE (_p_=0.055).

**Set C (β:δ): null hypotheses accepted.**

All tests showed vehicle _didn’t_ significantly affect DGE in asthmatic tissues compared to non-asthmatic.

## Combining results <a href="#chart_version_3" id="chart_version_3"></a>

_A correlation is indicated in Set B between genetic expression and tissues being asthmatic; the upregulation may be an intensification of the antiviral response._

Figure 2 presents the second-order comparison between the differential expression ratios. All genes are upregulated in both non-asthmatic (Set D, turquoise) and asthmatic (Set A, orange) HAEC immune response to HRV16. Set B (purple), compares the asthmatic and non-asthmatic HAEC responses to HRV16. Comparing the foldchange from each gene indicates a correlation between tissues being asthmatic and upregulated genetic expression: the ratio of each gene is similar, suggesting the asthmatic upregulation could be an intensification of the regular antiviral response.

_**Figure 2**: Comparison between DGE ratios of STAT2 and OAS genes, relative to control sample δ._

* _DGE ratios were recalibrated relative to control sample δ (vehicle treatment on non-asthmatic tissue) to compare the DGE of each gene directly._
* _DGE pairs were grouped by gene and by coloured by set for easy visual comparison._
* _Foldchange ratios between samples in each set were labelled (FC)._
* _**Legend key**: Left: Comparison sets (A,B,C,D) are colour-coded. Right: sample sets (α,β,γ,δ) are colour-coded by which comparison sets they appear in._

Baseline expressions (Set C, lime) of STAT2, OAS2 and STAT1 _(not pictured)_ were lower in asthmatic tissue than non-asthmatic (0.98x, 0.93x, 0.87x respectively), despite greater DGE in HRV16 response; but the analysis results were statistically insignificant, so likely represent natural fluctuations.
